# for Sean: when you finish getting all the items for a category
# make a call like db_utils.insertion_loop(dict, db_connection, db_cursor, table_num)
# where dict is a dictionary with unimportant keys and a list or tuple with the 5 data points
# for each product and table_num is 0 for headphones, 1 for microphones and so on.
# you can do this in here or in main, but you will need both db_connection and db_cursor

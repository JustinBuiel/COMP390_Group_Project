This project collects and filters Amazon’s product data for 6 search keywords:
  - Over Ear Headphones
  - USB Microphones
  - 1080p Webcams
  - Capture Cards
  - 8-channel Audio Mixers
  - Gaming Laptops

The User then filters by category, number of ratings, the rating itself, and the price and then stores them in a filtered file. 

To use the program, answer the questions using valid inputs, and then head over to the filtered data table to find all the results.
